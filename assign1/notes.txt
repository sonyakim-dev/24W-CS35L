Sort the directory names alphabetically and list just the first five names, or list them all if there are fewer than five names.
   `find /usr/local/cs -type d -newer /usr/local/cs/lib | sort | head -5`
   /usr/local/cs
   /usr/local/cs/autoconf-2.72
   /usr/local/cs/autoconf-2.72/bin

   /usr/local/cs/autoconf-2.72/share/autoconf

7. How many regular files are in the Python source code distribution located in the directory matching the globbing pattern /usr/local/cs/src/python/Python-*? Do not count directories or symbolic links or anything else; just regular files.
   `find /usr/local/cs/src/python/Python-* -type f | wc -l`
