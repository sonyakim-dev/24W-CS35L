    +# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
    +# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
    +# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
    +# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
    +# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
    +# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
    +# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
    +# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
