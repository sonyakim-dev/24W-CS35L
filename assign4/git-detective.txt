First, I tried to find the administrative merge commit by using `git log --grep="In read-only repositories"`
  commit 19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44

      Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo'

      In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
      merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
      led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.

      * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
        merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
        merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

I figured out that the change was made on 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' branch.
So I tried to find descendant commit of 19118cb857 by using `git log --graph --oneline 19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44`
  *   19118cb857 Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo'
  |\

  | * 0b55d930a6 merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
  * |   a215853545 Merge branch 'tb/midx-repack-ignore-cruft-packs'

I thought 0b55d930a6 would be related to the commit that I am looking for,
so I looked up the commit by using `git log 0b55d930a6`.

      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

      If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
      operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
      object which is however still set to `NULL`).

      Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
      `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.
